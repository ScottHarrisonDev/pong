# Potential Improvements
- Improve computer movement. I have played around with having the computer player move up and down towards the balls Y position at a given speed but this results in quite obvious movements which make the game impossible or too easy. It may work with some form of variation thrown in though. I've currently settled on having the computer player move up and down in a linear fashion.

- Collision detection could be improved. Currently if the ball were to hit the top or bottom of the paddles it would bounce back into the field. It should obviously bounce out of play into the goal.
